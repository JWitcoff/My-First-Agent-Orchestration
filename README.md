# ✈️ AI Travel Planner
> Designed, developed, and deployed by a product-minded builder eager to showcase applied AI integration, API orchestration, and agent architecture.

## 🧠 Overview

This is my **first fully functioning AI agent**, created to intelligently plan trips end-to-end. It combines OpenAI-powered reasoning with real-time flight and hotel logic via the Amadeus API. This project showcases my ability to go beyond “prompt engineering” — and actually architect systems that reason, fetch real-world data, and return structured outputs.

Users can interact with a sleek, mobile-friendly web interface to:

- Describe a trip in natural language or form inputs
- Get optimized flight and hotel recommendations
- See a full trip plan generated by agentic reasoning
- Adjust inputs and re-run on the fly

The result? A modular, extensible AI travel planner that’s useful, human-aligned, and production-capable.

## 🧩 Technical Architecture

| Layer                  | Tech Stack                                     |
|------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Frontend**           | HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS (single-page flow)      |
| **Backend**            | Python, Flask, Asyncio                        |
| **AI/LLM**             | OpenAI (GPT-4o default), tool-calling via function calling |
| **APIs**               | Amadeus API for live flight and hotel data    |
| **Agent Pattern**      | Modular class-based agents with handoffs      |
| **Schema Enforcement** | Pydantic for structured input/output validation |
| **Tool Logic**         | Custom hotel/flight search with fallback and fuzzy matching |
| **Deployment**         | Localhost Flask server (easily cloud-portable) |

## 🏗️ Key Features

✅ **Agent-Oriented Architecture**  
Three layered agents:
- `Travel Agent`: Orchestrates everything
- `Flight Agent`: Finds flights and prices via Amadeus
- `Hotel Agent`: Recommends hotels (even handles day trips)

✅ **Real-Time API Calls**  
Flight and hotel data is fetched live via Amadeus — not static or hardcoded.

✅ **Fuzzy Natural Language Understanding**  
Users can type "last week of June" or "tomorrow for 3 days" and the agent converts it into exact dates.

✅ **Front-to-Back Communication**  
Frontend sends JSON-formatted requests, backend runs the full reasoning loop with OpenAI + tools, then returns structured JSON responses rendered in-browser.

✅ **Built Without Booking.com**  
This version uses only Amadeus for both flights and hotels — no Booking.com integration exists anymore.

✅ **Structured, Maintainable Code**  
Organized with:
```
├── app
│   ├── agents (modular logic + tools)
│   ├── routes (Flask API)
│   └── templates (HTML frontend)
├── run.py
├── run_flask.py
```

## 🚀 How to Run Locally

1. **Install requirements** (Python 3.9+):
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Set environment variables** in a `.env` file:
   ```
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key
   AMADEUS_API_KEY=your-key
   AMADEUS_API_SECRET=your-secret
   MODEL_CHOICE=gpt-4o
   ```

3. **Run the server**:
   ```bash
   python run_flask.py
   ```

4. **Visit in browser**:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
